Hello! Welcome to my portfolio!

This is a collection of my recent work. I am currently enrolled in the 
Software Engineering bootcamp at Triple Ten's online coding program. I 
studied Technology, Art, and Media in undergraduate school at the University
of Colorado at Boulder. For the past decade, I have been working in the mental health and health care fields; mostly for Kaiser Permanente. 

I am excited to shift back to working in tech. I have been brushing up on my HTML and CSS skills, and learning Javascript in order to build websites and work on a web development team. 

For more information please see my Github or LinkedIn pages, both linked on this site. 

Thanks, 
Ana Maria Martinez
