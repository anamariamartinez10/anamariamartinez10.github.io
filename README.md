      <p>Hello! I learned HTML a long time ago in a far away kingdom. Then I travelled through a land of mental health. 
        I was a therapist in addiction medicine. Now, I'm wondering if being a clinician is the right path for me. 
        I am re-familiarizing myself with HTML, and learning CSS and Java Script. I think I want to work in tech and take a step 
        back from clinical work</p>
